Mi primo y yo hemos hecho la encuesta religiosa :P. Aquí estan los resultados, lo más fuerte es lo de satánicos O_o pero esto que ée... al final va a resultar que somos Ilumminatis ;-)

![atheism](/images/posts/atheism.gif)

You scored as **atheism**. You are... an atheist, though you probably already knew this. Also, you probably have several people praying daily for your soul.

Instead of simply being "nonreligious," atheists strongly believe in the lack of existence of a higher being, or God.

- atheism: 83%
- Satanism: 71%
- agnosticism: 67%
- Paganism: 54%
- Judaism: 50%
- Islam: 50%
- Buddhism: 50%
- Christianity: 21%
- Hinduism: 13%

![agnosticism](/images/posts/questionmark.jpg)

You scored as **agnosticism**. You are an agnostic. Though it is generally taken that agnostics neither believe nor disbelieve in God, it is possible to be a theist or atheist in addition to an agnostic. Agnostics don't believe it is possible to prove the existence of God (nor lack thereof).

Agnosticism is a philosophy that God's existence cannot be proven. Some say it is possible to be agnostic and follow a religion; however, one cannot be a devout believer if he or she does not truly believe.

- agnosticism: 79%
- Satanism: 75%
- atheism: 75%
- Paganism: 50%
- Islam: 38%
- Buddhism: 29%
- Christianity: 29%
- Hinduism: 17%
- Judaism: 17%
