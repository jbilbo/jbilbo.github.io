Una web que [edgar](http://www.lapeig.com) puso en la [lista](https://listas.hispalinux.es/mailman/listinfo/gplurv) de [GPLtarragona](http://www.gpltarragona.org) me llevo a estos ejemplos de conversaciones de IRC.

La web es esta: [http://www.bash.org/?top](http://www.bash.org/?top) y aquí os pongo algunas de las que me han hecho más gracia (están en inglés).
